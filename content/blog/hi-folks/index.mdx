description: This is a short explanation of the goals and decisions taken during the creation of a scaffolding fir React Native apps.
---

The main goal for this repo is to prepare a base environment to create applications with [Expo](https://expo.io/),
do you still don’t know what Expo is? As its website clearly states Expo is a set of tools and services
built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS,
Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

## Managed vs Bare

The first decision when you create an Expo project is choosing between Expo Managed and Bare Workflow, this scaffolding
goes for the first, basically because I only want to write Javascript or Typescript and give back all the complexity of
dealing with the native side to Expo. It is true that this decision will impose some limitations but I could live with
them for the moment.

## TypeScript

Using javascript or typescript is another decision we have to take during the initialization. And I’ll take Typescript
mainly because it will make my code easier to understand, giving me a clearer interface for my components and functions.
And on top of that it will be more difficult to introduce the kind of stupid bugs I use to do, basically because the
compiler won’t let me introduce them.

## Static Testing

Typescript could also be included in this paragraph dedicated to the tools that will help us catch errors while we write code.
A part of Typescript I will add a configuration to use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and its extension for VSCode. Prettier is a code formatter and
you will discover soon that formatting sometimes brings to light mistakes on the code. Besides that, the major tool for static
testing is [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). ESLint lets you set a set of rules which analyze statically the code you write and warn you about potential errors.
For this Scaffolding I’ve decided to extend the following sets of rules.

```javascript
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:react/recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',

```

And there is more, I have linked this ESLint configuration with the VSCode ESLint extension and the same editor is warning me about the issues as
soon as I introduce them. Finally using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky#readme) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#readme) I am able to run my
ESLint rules on the staged code I want to commit and stop the action in case some issue is found.

## React testing library

Finally no project is complete with a proper set of integration tests. In order to do that this Scaffolding is going to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and
the [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/), this library takes out the best of Jest making easy to write tests much more similar to the way a real
user will be interacting with your app, avoiding testing implementation details which turn refactorings in a eternal nightmare of failing tests.
